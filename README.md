# The ToyCollector sample application
This repository contains a code sample for my 'Build software like a bag of marbles, not a castle of Lego' talk.

The focus is on:
* Onion Architecture
* Plugin Design
* Building extension points into an existing application using DI (Autofac)
* Expanding ASP.NET Core with plugins
* Expanding EF Core with plugins
* Handle migrations in a plugin scenario
